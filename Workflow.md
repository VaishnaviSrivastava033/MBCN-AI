## ðŸ“Œ High-Level Workflow

The workflow of MBCN AI revolves around **role-based access**, **student-centered data management**, and **modular progression** across assessments, planning, execution, and reporting.

### 1. Custom User Authentication & Role Assignment

* Custom users register or log in.
* The system assigns role-based permissions:

  * **Super Admin** â†’ Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  * **Admin** â†’ CRU (no delete).
  * **Teacher** â†’ Manage students, assessments, IEPs, progress reports.
  * **Therapist** â†’ Manage therapies, update progress, contribute to IEPs.
  * **Guardian** â†’ Mostly read-only access, guided by home management modules.

### 2. Student Registration Workflow

1. A teacher/admin/therapist creates a new student profile.
2. Data captured includes personal details (name, age, disability), guardian details, and initial program assignment.
3. Once registered, the student record becomes the **central hub** for all future data (assessments, IEP, therapy, reports).

1. Teacher/Admin generates periodic reports.
2. Report aggregates:

   * Assessments
